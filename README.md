passberry
=========

Simple chrome extension that allows you to keep a list of your passwords on hand in the browser.

Passberry serves as basic list for passwords to replace the sticky notes / word documents you may have to store your passwords on.
Passberry does not communicate with any external server and everything is stored locally in your browser.

Suggestions welcome on how to improve - like how right now there is no delete password functionality.
